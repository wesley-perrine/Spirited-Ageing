        <h1>Wine Cellar Design Ideas</h1><br>
        <p>The following questions will help you think about your wine cellar requirements and hopefully trigger some ideas about your specific needs.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Cellar Capacity</h2><br>
        <p><span>Background:</span> Wine racking will typically hold about 9 bottles per square foot of wall space.</p><br>
        <p>Do you have a collection of wines now?  If so, how many bottles?</p><br>
        <p>Is it a constant or a growing collection?</p>
        <p>What is the expected total capacity?</p><br>
        <p>What type of collection should we plan for?</p>
        <ul>
            <li> % of 750ml</li>
            <li> Champagnes/Burgundy</li>
            <li>Magnums</li>
            <li>Splits</li>
            <li>Large-format and others.  Provide diameter of any odd-sized bottles.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Is you wine cellar intended to be primarily a “showcase” or are you looking to maximize storage positions?</p><br>
        
        
        <h2>Environmental Control</h2><br>
        <p><span>Background:</span>  A consistent cool temperature is best for aging wines.  A temperature of 58 degrees is ideal for aging fine wines.  70% humidity is ideal for preserving corks.  Cooling systems designed specifically for wine cellars typically retain 55-65% humidity.  </p><br>
        <p>Is your cellar a passive cellar (not needing a cooling system)?</p><br>
        <p>Is your cellar one requiring consultation on the proper insulation and the right cooling system to regulate the temperature and humidity??</p>
        <p>Is the foundation poured or is it still possible to put insulation under the wine cellar slab (greatest source of heat in Florida cellars is through the floor)?<p></p><br>
        <p>Do you want to use extra techniques to increase the humidity?</p><br>
        
        <h2>Cellar Layout</h2><br>
        <p><span>Background:</span> Safe, sturdy racks are typically 13” deep.  Walkways in front of racks should ideally be 36”.  Square rooms provide the most options for unique features – niches, waterfall racks, rounded corners.</p><br>
        <p>Do you want racking to the ceiling?   If not, do you want to stop at 7 feet? 8 feet?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want a rolling ladder to reach top rack locations?</p>
        <p>What kind of racking do you want?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual Racks – 750 ml, Champagne/burgundy, Magnum, other</li>
            <li>Display rows – high reveal display allows label to show.</li>
            <li>Square corners or rounded corners </li>
            <li>Waterfall racking</li>
            <li>Diamond bins (9 bottle or 16 bottle diamond bins)? Diamonds are good for storing dessert wines that are too thin for individual bins.</li>
            <li>Wooden Case Bins</li>
            <li>Rectangular bins/card board case bins</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Do you want an island counter with bottle storage underneath?</p><br>
        <p>Do you need double-deep racking?</p><br>
        <p>Is a Stemware rack needed? How many stems?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want drawers in the decanting area?</p><br>
        <p>Should we build in a Cigar Humidor?</p><br>
        
        <h2>Racking Wood and Finish</h2><br>
        <p><span>Background:</span> Wine Cellar racks are traditionally created from Redwood.  The superior grade Clear All-Heart Redwood provides a more consistent color and wood grain appearance than you will find with other manufacturers’ Premium All-Heart Redwood.</p><br>
        <p>Redwood does not accept stain well.  If you are thinking of a dark stain, you would likely order racking in a less costly wood (Birch or Pine) and apply the stain.</p><br>
        <p>What kind of wood do you want for the racking?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear All-Heart Redwood</li>
            <li>Mahogany</li>
            <li>Walnut </li>
            <li>Western Red Cedar</li>
            <li>Cherry</li>
            <li>Birch</li>
            <li>Pine</li>
            <li>Other</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Do you want the racks stained?</p><br>
        <p>Painted racking?</p><br>
      
        <h2>Door</h2><br>
        <p><span>Background:</span> Doors for a climate-controlled cellar should be exterior grade doors at least 1.5” thick with at least a R5 insulating factor.  Door should have full weather-stripping.
        </p><br>
        <p>What kind of door are you envisioning?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solid Wood
                <ul>
                    <li>What kind of wood – Redwood, or other?</li>
                    <li>Do you want a window in the door?</li>
                    <li> Do you want the door carved?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Full Light Door
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you want glass etched, beveled, or a stained glass design?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>   
            <li>Wrought Iron Door</li>
          </ul><br>
        
        
        <h2>Aesthetics</h2><br>
        <p><span>Background:</span> It is best to plan for the aesthetics of your cellar during construction.  Adjustments must be made early to allow for thicker walls for stone accents or tile murals.  Extra plumbing may be needed for a sink.
        </p><br>
        <p>Step down into cellar?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want a decanting niche?  What kind of niche?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arched, square, stair stepped, fluted columns, </li>
            <li>Solid or latticed sides</li>
            <li>Double-deep counter?</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Do you want shelves for displaying decanters or art pieces?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want a tasting table inside the cellar (keep in mind that, if your cellar is cooled, you will be tasting in 58 degree temperatures!).</p><br>
        <p>Do you want openings in the racking to showcase art pieces?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want wall art – murals, tile mural, etc?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want a sink inside the cellar?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want any floor medallions?</p><br>
        <p>How do you want your ceiling – flat, barrel, beamed, covered with tongue in groove redwood, faux stone, etc.?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want your walls textured or stone covered walls in non-racked areas?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want traditional crown moldings or a more contemporary square molding?</p><br>
        
        <h2>Lighting</h2><br>
        <p><span>Background:</span> Lighting can make a huge impact on the impressiveness of the cellar.  Planning for electrical needs early will reduce the change orders needed later in the construction process. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Step down into cellar?</p><br>
        
        <p>What kind of display row lighting do you want – rope lighting, thin under cabinet, other LCD/Zenon lighting systems?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want a hanging light fixture from the center of the cellar?  Do you need sconce lighting on walls?</p><br>
        <p>Will you use can lighting?  Consider use of Air lock fixtures to avoid condensation.</p><br>
        <p>Do you want to use lamp lighting on your decanting niche?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want a sink inside the cellar?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want the lights to go on when the wine cellar door is opened (door hinge light switch)?</p><br>
        <p>Do you want the overhead lighting and display lighting switched separately?</p><br>
